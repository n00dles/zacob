Golang IOT Home Automation System

This is my first attempt at a Golang application for my internal home automation system which will use various clients (esp8266, onion omega 2, raspberry pi's etc ) to comminicate with this system over websockets. 

As Go is very new to me the coding WILL be crap, but it will work !!
